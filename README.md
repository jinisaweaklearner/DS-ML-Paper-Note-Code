# ML-papers

*One weekend one paper!*

Nowadays, there are more and more ML related papers. Here, the target is to read those important papers in practice. So, we can have a better understanding of how the algorithms work.

## Tree-based
* LightGBM: A Highly Efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree [[Paper]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf) [[Notes]](notes/LightGBM.md) 
* XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754.pdf) [[Notes]](notes/XGBoost.pdf) 

## Imbalanced problem
* SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1813.pdf) [[Notes]](notes/Smote.pdf) 

## Next Papers
