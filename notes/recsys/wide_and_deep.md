`memorization` and `generalization` are two main challenges

Memorization of `feature interactions` through a wide set of `cross-product feature transformations` are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort.

Dense embeddings will lead to nonzero predictions for all query-item pairs (but `no interactions` between most query-item pairs)
