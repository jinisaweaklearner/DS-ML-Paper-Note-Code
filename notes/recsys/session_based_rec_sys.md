# Session-based recommendation algorithms
 
### Definition
Session-based recommendation algorithms rely heavily on the user’s most recent interactions, rather than on the user’s historical preferences.

### Advantage
In addition, this approach is especially advantageous because a user could appear anonymously—that is, a user may not be logged in or may be browsing incognito.

### Issue of traditional rec sys algorithms
- All of the historical interactions are equally important to the user’s current preference, this may not be true. Users' preference can change over time.
